            <h2>About the language</h2>
            <p>
                Where I live, there was a massive and very long protest by our parliament that I had to walk through/by each day on my daily commute.
            I hated the protest after a weekish so much that I decided I'd make a language that sounded not English that I could use in case anyone confronted me.
            I had already decided that one of the words was simply going to be a triarticulated trill (bilabial, alveolar, and uvular) followed by /a/, and then the triarticulated trill, schwa vowel and then a glottal stop.
            </p>
            </br>
            <h2>The Evolution of the Phonetic Inventory</h2>
            <p>
                The original plan for the phonology is as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Trills & Ejectives (maybe implosives)</li>
                    <li>4 vowels + tones (contour only)</li>
                    <li>Gemination and vowel length</li>
                </ul>
                This could've most definitely achieve the set goal of the language, however, I then decided to change it mainly so that I would've not bitten off too much that I could chew for my then second major conlang.
