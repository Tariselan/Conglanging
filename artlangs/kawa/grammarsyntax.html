                <h2>Nouns</h2>
                <p>
                    Nouns decline for 3 cases, the cases are as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Nominative - used when the noun is the subject or the predicate nominative. The thing or person doing the acion: People love me: <i>pesomo mwa imo</i>.</li>
                        <li>Accusative - used when the noun is the direct object. The thing being acted upon: I love people: <i>imo mwa pesomo</i>.</li>
                        <li>Genitive - used when the noun is the possessor of or connected with an object: The cat's hair: <i>hawamo gati</i>; the agent of a passive verb: The person was injured by me: <i>o goŋ knot pesomo iŋi</i>; and the partitive:. </li>
                        <li>Dative - used when the noun is the indirect object or being used in a comparison, certain verbs will also change meaning if the object is dative (<i>tambi</i> to thank, to give thanks to + DAT): I gave them a cat: <i>imo goŋ dewo gato sovia</i>; I am better than you: <i>imo gaŋqe asimus ta</i>.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Note that the nominative and accusative case are identical for all nouns and the distinction is only made in the derogatory pronouns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nouns indicate noun case by changing their ending. The ending of the noun depends on whether or not the base-form of the noun ends in a consonant (C) or a vowel (V). They decline as follows:

                <h3>Derogatory Pronouns and Derogatress</h3>
                <p>
                    Take the sentence, "You are a nerd." The senteice isn't itself inherently considered an insult (or with having a derogatory sense), but in many dialects of Modern English, because of history and culture, it tends to be an insult. 
                    However, it needs not to be, and often its intent/derogatress is often shown/inferred using things such as context, tone, non-verbal language, etc etc.
                    <pre>   You are a nerd. -> <i>teo gaŋqe qiqamo</i></pre>
                    This sentence is merely a statement of fact <i><b>without</b></i> any intent of being an insult, moreso to describe. (LIT: you have the quality of a nerd)
                    <br>
                    Compare this with the sentence:
                    <pre>   You are a nerd, -> <i>dƿeo gaŋqe qiqamo</i></pre>
                    This sentence implies moreso an insulting tone, with the intent to insult the listener, whereas <i>teo</i> just implies a general statement, <i>dƿeo</i> implies a more insulting manner of delivery. <br>
                    <br>
                    The derogatory and non-derogatory distinction is very similar to that of the T-V distinction found in a lot of romantic languages. 
                    Except here it is applier in a more general context in a slightly different manner. <br>
                    NOTE: Although derogatory can be analysed as informal, the derogatory is often used in insulting, joking, et al manners  which tend to happen in informal contexts.
                    <i>teo</i> is still used in preference by Kawa speakers in informal contexts.

                    Kawa uses auxiliary verbs to express different moods and aspects. 
                    Auxiliaries have two forms, one before verbs beginning with a consonant, and one that elides before a verb beginning with a vowel.

                <h2>Adjectives and Adverbs</h2>
                <p>
                    In Kawa, there is no distinction between adjectives and adverbs. However, whenever a word is being used as an adjective, it goes before the noun. 
                    Whereas when it is being used as an adverb, it is used at the end of a sentence or after the verb.
